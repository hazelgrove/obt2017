We typically only consider running programs that we have finished
writing. Programmers therefore end up inserting ad hoc dummy values into
their intermediate work to be able to observe its dynamic behavior. In this
work we present a mechanism for the safe evaluation programs that are still
incomplete, substantially tightening the development loop.
