We typically only consider running programs that we have finished
writing. Programmers therefore end up inserting ad hoc dummy values into
their intermediate edits to be able to observe their dynamic behavior. In
this work we present a mechanism for the safe evaluation programs that are
still incomplete by propagating holes through steps whenever possible,
substantially tightening the development loop.
