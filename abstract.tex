We typically only consider running programs that are completely written. Programmers end up inserting ad hoc dummy values into
their incomplete programs to receive feedback about its dynamic behavior. In 
this work we suggest a evaluation mechanism for incomplete programs, i.e. programs that still contain holes. Rather than immediately failing when a hole is encountered, we propagate holes as far as possible. The result is a substantially tighter development loop.
