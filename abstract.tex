We typically only consider running programs that are completely
written. Programmers end up inserting ad hoc dummy values into their
incomplete programs to receive feedback about dynamic behavior. In this
work we suggest an evaluation mechanism for incomplete programs,
represented as terms with holes. Rather than immediately failing when a
hole is encountered, evaluation propagates holes as far as possible. The
result is a substantially tighter development loop.
